	    <strong>French production methods introduced to County Dublin</strong>
	    <p>Barry Buttermilk, head cheese-maker at Croom Creamery in County Dublin, has
		recently returned from a fact-finding mission to France. So impressed was he with le
		fromage Français that he intends introducing French production methods to his
		factory. Mostly these methods involve a lot of shrugging and going on strike.
