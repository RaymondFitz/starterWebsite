        <p>We are delighted to announce that <i>Killorglin Mountain Goat Cheese</i> has been

	   of a pole in the making of this cheese. Promise.</p>
	   
	<strong>Charleville chocolate-coated cheese in national distribution</strong>
	<p><i>ChocoCheese</i>, a delicious, fresh-ripened sheep’s cheese coated with dark chocolate,
	   previously available only in Charleville, has now gone into national distribution. If
	   you want to get your kids to eat more cheese, buy them <i>ChocoCheese</i>!</p>
	   <b>Warning:</b> May turn the bread brown.
	   
	   <h3>August 2017</h3>
	   <strong>Product recall: <i>Bray Brie</i></strong>
	   <p>Customers are advised that recent batches of Bray Brie are <b>infested</b> with worms. Big
	      worms. Worms of the <i>priapulida</i> family. These worms are <b>poisonous</b>.</p>
	   <p><b>Do not eat this cheese.</b> Nor the worms. Return this cheese to your retailer.</p>
	   
	   <h3>July 2017</h3>
	   <strong>French production methods introduced to County Dublin</strong>
	   <p>Barry Buttermilk, head cheese-maker at Croom Creamery in County Dublin, has
	      recently returned from a fact-finding mission to France. So impressed was he with le
	      fromage Français that he intends introducing French production methods to his
	      factory. Mostly these methods involve a lot of shrugging and going on strike. 
	   </p>
	   <strong>Irish cheese exports boom</strong>
	   <p>Irish cheese exports to Europe are flourishing but there are signs that the American
	      market is saturated with fat.
